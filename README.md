# Capstone_COVID19Prediction_Project
The COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, was described by the World Health Organization (WHO) because the virus's unchallenged spread was declared a pandemic on March 11th, while the exponential rise in the number of cases threatened to overwhelm health systems worldwide with a demand for hospitalization
It is crucial to make some recommendations to the hospital in acceptance of patient into hospital. Setting up requirements for testing was crucial in order to concentrate on receiving test results quickly and also to stop the virus's spread as soon as possible.
## A. Dataset: 
The patients who visited the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in So Paulo, Brazil, and had samples drawn for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and other laboratory tests while they were there are included in this dataset in an anonymous form. 

## B. Content: 

1. Health systems around the world were in danger of being overrun by the exponential increase of COVID cases due to the demand for hospitalization and ICU beds exceeding their capacity.

2. Testing every patient with a few minor symptoms would be problematic in the setting of a health system that is already overcrowded and may have a limit on the tests that can be run to look for SARS-CoV-2.

## C. Problems that were Addressed: 

1. Improve a classification model that forecasts the likelihood of testing positive or negative for COVID19 based on the laboratory data gathered from the suspected cases.
2. What characteristics might affect a patient's admission to a hospital?

## D. Running Script Instructions: 
1. Setup requirements.txt
2. Open `PredictCovid.ipynb` file.
